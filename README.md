# 📖 BrightEducation Reader Unlocker

This tool is designed to help students with **Dyslexia** or other reading needs by making digital textbooks more accessible. It "unlocks" the book reader so you can use text-to-speech tools like **Speechify**.

## 🧐 What is this?
Many digital textbooks block your ability to right-click or highlight text to prevent copying. However, this also blocks helpful tools like **Speechify** from reading the text aloud to you. 

This script is a **Userscript**—a tiny piece of helper code that runs only on your computer. It tells the website to stop blocking your mouse, allowing you to highlight words and listen to them as you study.

##Note for EdTech Companies

Fuck you. Knowledge is free and infinate. Ebook 'renting' is a farce, and you should be ashamed for profiteering off of files and text on a screen. There is **no such thing** as artificial scarcity in the digital world; for your firm to force a physical-world profit model onto a digital medium is both hilarious and laughable. We will do everything in our power to reduce your revenue and liberate knowledge for the entire world, regardless of location or income."
